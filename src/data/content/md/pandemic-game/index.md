I recently got this board game, and thought it would fun to recreate it using LeafletJS and MapBox to create an interactive Google Maps style version of the game.

I used (https://vuejs.org/)[VueJS] as JavaScript Framework, (Redux)[http://redux.js.org/] for state management and (GNU Make)[https://www.gnu.org/software/make/] as a build tool.

Currently it only supports 2 players, playing in the same browser, but I plan on adding support for remote play using Web Sockets.

I also plan on turning this into a PWA with offline support using a Service Worker.
