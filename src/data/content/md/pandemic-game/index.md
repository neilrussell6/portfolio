Pandemic game
=============

[View project on Github](https://github.com/neilrussell6/vuejs-leafletjs-pandemic-game)

I recently got this board game, and thought it would fun to recreate it using LeafletJS and MapBox to create an interactive Google Maps style version of the game.
I used (https://vuejs.org/)[VueJS] as JavaScript Framework, (Redux)[http://redux.js.org/] for state management and (GNU Make)[https://www.gnu.org/software/make/] as a build tool.
Currently it only supports 2 players, playing in the same browser, but I plan on adding support for remote play using Web Sockets.
I also plan on turning this into a PWA with offline support using a Service Worker.
