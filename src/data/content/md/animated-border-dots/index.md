SVG / D3 Animated Border Dots
=============================

Dot with a tail
---------------

First I started with a polygon and a dot animating along i's lines. The dot has a tail the length of the line it's currently moving along.

Fixed length tail
-----------------

Next I update the tail so that it's length is fixed.
