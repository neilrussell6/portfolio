Fancy Counter
-------------

This is a purely educational project that attempts to illustrate the different approaches of various JS frameworks, and also how they compare to vanilla JS when creating a simple reusable counter component.
So far I've done the VueJS, and plan to also do it with Angular 2 & ReactJS.
