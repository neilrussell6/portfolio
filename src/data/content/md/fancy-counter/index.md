Story
-----

So I started with a vanilla JavaScript version and then implemented the VueJS JavaScript framework.

The purpose was to compare the different processes & result of the various frameworks and also to compare the vanilla version to each framework implementation.

Although I only got as far as implementing VueJS, I do plan to continue and implement both Angular 2 and ReactJS.
